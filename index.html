                What you get and what you see
                Things that don't come easily
                Feeling happy in my vein
                Icicles within my brain (cocaine)
                Something blowing in my head
                Winter's ice, it soon will spread
                Death would freeze my very soul
                Makes me happy, makes me cold
                My eyes are blind but I can see
                The snowflakes glisten on the trees
                The sun no longer sets me free
                I feel there's no place freezing me
                Let the winter sun shine on
                Let me feel the frost of dawn
                Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
                Soon I'll feel the chilling glow
                Right
                Don't you think I know what I'm doing
                Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
                You're the one who's really the loser
                This is where I feel I belong
                Crystal world with winter flowers
                Turn my days to frozen hours
                Lying snowblind in the sun
                Will my ice age ever come?

                Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
                Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
                Find another world where freedom waits, yeah
                Past the stars in fields of ancient void
                Through the shields of darkness where they find
                Love upon a land a world unknown
                Where the sons of freedom make their home
                Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
                Leave them to their future in the grave
